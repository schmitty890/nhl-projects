# Starting a new project

### Branches

We differentiate our projects by branches on our repository. Each branch is its own separate project, so you can simply checkout a project and get working on your local. Or create a branch to start a new project all together!

### Creating a branch

You can create a new branch directly from your terminal or code editor with the git command with the -b flag.

Naming convention for branches make sense for organizing. So we can follow something like `project/type-of-project/versionNumber`, like shown below.

`git checkout -b project/react/v1`

Push your code up to your branch to be stored in the repo, and share with others, collaborate, play around, and have fun :sunglasses:
