# Docs Intro

Let's discover **NHL projects in less than 5 minutes**.

This site is documentation on different types of projects, from locating the branch name, the project tech stack, how to get up and running with each individual project. Much like a coding playground where experimenting with code can easily happen!

These docs are created using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

See the [docusaurus requirements](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#requirements) on how to run a docusaurus project to get up and running on your local and contribute.
